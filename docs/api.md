API
---

_redux-json-api_ provides a simple API for all four CRUD actions.

- Create resource object using [createEntity](#createentity-resource-object--promise)
- Read endpoints through [readEndpoint](#readendpoint-endpoint-string--promise)
- Update resource with [updateEntity](#updateentity-resource-object--promise)
- Delete resource using [deleteEntity](#deleteentity-resource-object--promise)

## Resource objects

Whenever there's referred to a resource object or entity, it must conform to [JSON API specifications](http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-objects).

## Resource endpoints

_redux-json-api_ resolves resource objects to endpoints based on their specified type. The following resource will update and delete to _/tasks/1_:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "type": "tasks",
  "attributes": {
    "title": "Lorem ipsum"
  }
}
```

While dispatching a create action for the following resource will make a request to _/tasks_:

```json
{
  "type": "tasks",
  "attributes": {
    "title": "Lorem ipsum"
  }
}
```


## API Promises
The _redux-json-api_'s CRUD API methods will all return a single promise. The fulfillment handler will receive one argument with the response body. One exception to this is the fulfillment handler from a `deleteEntity` promise, which will not receive any arguments.


## API Methods

Note: Return values noted below are after dispatch, i.e. `dispatch(createEntity({ ... }))`.

#### `createEntity( resource: object ): Promise`
